# GOAL

This project aims to create an autonomous surveillance system. What I hope with this is to implement differents concepts as computer vision, LLM's, behavior trees, SLAM, multi robot cooperation and much more in a system that I think that has many different applications. 

We can have a system like this one for survaillance of civil or military installations, as well as larger forest areas, finding new fire spots and acting quickly.

For this prototype I will be using very simple robots as the turtlebot and the crazyflie 2.1 drone. Just as a concept proof.
